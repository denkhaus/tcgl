/*
 A simple but powerful client for accessing the Redis database. After establishing 
 a connection using NewRedisDatabase() commands can be executed with Command(). So 
 every command of Redis is possible. The method returns a ResultSet with different 
 methods for success testing and access to the retrieved values. The method 
 MultiCommand() can be used for transactions. The passed function gets a MultiCommand 
 instance as argument for calling the inner Command() methods.
